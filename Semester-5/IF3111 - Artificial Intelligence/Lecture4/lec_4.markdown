### Hill-climbing Search: Greedy Local Search
---
Hill climbing is a local search optimization algorithm that iteratively moves
from the current solution to a neighboring solution that has a lower cost. The
algorithm terminates when a local minimum is reached.
Hill climbing is simple and efficient algorithm, but it can get stuck in local
minima, To avoid this, a number of variants of hill climbing have been
developed, such as simulated annealing and iterated local search.
