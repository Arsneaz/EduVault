## Learning Agent

### Concept of Learning
---
"Learning" enters the fray when we give these models tunable parameters that can be adapted to observed data; in this way the program can be considered to be "learning" from the data.

### Categories of Machine Learning
---
Machine Learning can be categorized into two main types: *Supervised learning* and *unsupervised learning*

1. Supervied Learning
Supervised learning involves somehow modeling the relationship between measured features of data and some labels associated with the data; once this model is determined, it can be used to apply labels to new, unknown data. This is sometimes further subdivided into classification tasks and regression tasks: in classification, the labels are discrete categories, while in regression, the labels are continuous quantities. You will see examples of both types of supervised learning in the following section.

2. Unsupervised learning involves modeling the features of a dataset without reference to any label. These models include tasks such as clustering and dimensionality reduction. Clustering algorithms identify distinct groups of data, while dimensionality reduction algorithms search for more succinct representations of the data. You will also see examples of both types of unsupervised learning in the following section.
