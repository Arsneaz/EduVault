### Intro To Knowledge Representation
---
Instead of thinking about all the ways a world could be, we're going to work in
a language of expression that describes those sets (A language to represent
knowledge / information).
Which we can can write on a syntax (Description of what you're allowed to
write down, what the expression are that are legal in a language)

### Generic Knowledge-based
---
Knowledge base is the central component of knowledge based agent / system ->
KBS, we can simplified further:
```yaml
Input: percept; Output: action
function KB_AGENT(percept) -> action
  TELL(KB, percept)       {assert percept)
  action <- ASK (KB)      {reasoning}
  TELL(KB, action)        {assert action}
```
Percepts and reasoning result (including action) is stored in working memory.

### More about KBS later

### Genetic Algorithm 
---
Proses seleksi alam, dimana individu dengan kemampuan bertahan hidup yang lebih
baik, yang akan terus bertahan di dalam populasi kehidupan

#### Rekapulasi Materi tentang pemilihan state berikut
1. Hill-Climbing Search: berdasarkan nilai objectifnya
2. Genetic Algorithm: berdasarkan aturan seleksi alam yang diterakpan pada
   state collection (disebut populasi)
